2011-07-17 16:22:26	Shirakawasuna	I'm doing some super basic webdev stuff (apache server,  mysql, php, javascript) for a database.  It was set up by someone else and I have essentially zero experience with webdev.  Lately I've been doing minor tweaks on the production-level site, but this is of course very dangerous (and I want to start doing more serious tweaks).  Could someone point me in the right direction for safely pushing updates/database tweaks (and editing
2011-07-17 16:22:26	Shirakawasuna	them locally, etc), if not an entire guide on this stuff?

2011-07-17 16:23:03	Shirakawasuna	my current method right now is to rsync backup the whole site, then tweak, then hope stuff doesn't explode

2011-07-17 16:23:31	demonicm1niac3	the speedup is what you save on bandwith compared to raw
2011-07-17 16:23:33	juhl	demonicm1niac3: not arguing that... but with ecc/chipkill ram and the like, panics due to random bitflips are getting rare - and even when they do happen they still have to flip something significant, not just unused memory or some data where they don't cause a crash - odds are pretty low with proper hardware...

I just wanted to verify that it's possible to edit this stuff 'offline' and merge it w/ production without removing their entries.  Also, I'll stop bothering you with newb questions ;)
