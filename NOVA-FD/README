NOVA FLASH DRIVE

SanDisk Cruzer 8GB
Running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with AwesomeWM

Flash Drive OS built to be able to be carried from computer to computer and still have Linux and my setup.

I started by installing Xubuntu, then completely removing Xubuntu from the system, leaving me with just the Ubuntu shell, then I continued by installing AwesomeWM and all the awesome Libraries, and made it look as close to my desktop as I could so I have something I'm comfortable with.
